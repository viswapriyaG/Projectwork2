## Phishing Website Detection Using Machine Learning
It identifies phishing websites by analyzing their URL structure, content, and visual design, addressing advanced techniques like obfuscated URLs, malicious scripts, and visual mimicry.

<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Phishing attacks mimic legitimate websites to steal sensitive information, posing a significant cybersecurity threat.
Traditional methods like blacklists and rule-based systems fail to detect evolving phishing techniques, such as obfuscated URLs, malicious content, and visual mimicry.
The purpose of this project is to develop a robust, multi-modal phishing website detection system using machine learning to enhance user safety and security in the digital space. 
It identifies phishing websites by analyzing their URL structure, content, and visual design, addressing advanced techniques like obfuscated URLs, malicious scripts, and visual mimicry.
